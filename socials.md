Claude 4.5 Opus made me upgrade from a 16GB MacBook Air to 48GB Pro.

Running multiple Claude Code sessions with subagents + Chrome + VS Code was crashing everything.

So I built RAMBar — a menu bar app that shows RAM by Claude session, Chrome tab, and more.

brew install maxghenis/tap/rambar

Claude 4.5 Opus broke my laptop.

Not literally—but after it launched, my Claude Code usage exploded. Multiple sessions, subagents spawning across projects, plus Chrome tabs and VS Code workspaces. My 16GB MacBook Air couldn't keep up. VS Code kept crashing.

I upgraded to a 48GB MacBook Pro, which mostly solved it. But I still had no visibility into what was consuming memory. Activity Monitor shows processes, not answers like "which Claude session is the hog?" or "can I spawn another subagent?"

So I built RAMBar—a native macOS menu bar app that shows RAM the way developers think about it:

- Claude Code sessions (main vs subagent, expandable to see each)
- Chrome tabs by memory (expandable)
- VS Code, Python, Docker, and more
- Click any app to bring it to foreground

Now I can see at a glance whether I have headroom for more subagents, or if I need to close some Chrome tabs first.

Install: brew install maxghenis/tap/rambar

My 16GB MacBook Air couldn't handle Claude 4.5 Opus.

Running multiple Claude Code sessions with subagents was crashing VS Code constantly. Upgraded to 48GB, but still wanted visibility into what's eating RAM.

Built RAMBar — shows memory by Claude session (main vs subagent), Chrome tab, and more. Click to expand details or activate apps.
