Claude Opus 4.5 kept crashing my VS Code.

So I built RAMBar — my first macOS app (100% Claude Code) — a menu bar monitor that shows RAM by Claude session, Chrome tab, and more.

Claude Opus 4.5 kept crashing my VS Code.

Nothing wrong with the model — it was just so good that I started running 5, 6, even a dozen Claude Code sessions at once. My 16GB MacBook Air couldn't keep up. VS Code kept crashing.

I upgraded to a 48GB MacBook Pro, which mostly solved the crashes, but I still had no visibility into what was eating memory. Activity Monitor shows processes, but not answers like "which Claude session is the hog?" or "can I spawn another subagent?"

So I built RAMBar — my first macOS app, built entirely with Claude Code.

It sits in your menu bar and shows RAM the way developers think about it:
- Claude Code sessions (main vs subagent, expandable to see each)
- Chrome tabs by memory (expandable)
- VS Code, Python, Docker, and more
- Click any app to bring it to foreground

Now I can see at a glance whether I have headroom for more subagents, or if I need to close some Chrome tabs first.

Claude Opus 4.5 kept crashing my VS Code.

I was running too many Claude Code sessions at once. Upgraded from 16GB to 48GB, but still had no visibility into what's eating RAM.

Built RAMBar — my first macOS app, made entirely with Claude Code. Shows memory by Claude session (main vs subagent), Chrome tab, and more.
