Just shipped RAMBar, a native macOS menu bar app for monitoring RAM usage.

When you're running Claude Code + VS Code + Chrome + Jupyter, Activity Monitor's process list isn't helpful. You want to know: which Claude session is using memory? Which VS Code workspace is the hog? Which Chrome tab should I close?

RAMBar answers those questions with developer-focused breakdowns:
- Claude Code sessions (main vs subagent)
- VS Code workspaces
- Chrome tabs by memory
- Python processes

Plus a retro-futuristic dashboard for when you want more detail.
